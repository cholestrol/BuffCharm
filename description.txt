Tired of constantly having to grind for buff potions? 
Hate having to always lug a ton of potions to boss fights? 
Do you struggle to even use your potions?

Introducing the Buff Charm mod!

With this mod, you can use your old buff potions to craft a new type of "accessory" called charms. 
These are equipped in new slots found under your player's inventory, so they don't take up any actual accessory slots.
Charms give your player certain permanent buffs depending on the type of charm it is!
Craft a charm with a stack of 10 buff potions and 6 gold or platinum bars at an anvil. Note that not all buff potions can be turned into charms.
Certain charms can even be combined with each other at an anvil!

Huge shoutout to abluescarab for their custom item slot wrapper! This mod would have taken me much, much longer without it!
